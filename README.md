### Info

This repo serves as more or less a micro-frontend for the alexander-littleton.github.io domain. The main repo for that domain is written in React and this repo acts as as intermediary way to house some of the legacy JS applications I wrote as a Google Ads analyst. The idea is to eventually move those over to the main github pages repo.
